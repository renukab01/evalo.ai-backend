Could you tell me about your experience with Python? I've been working with Python for about 3 years now. I've mainly used it for web development with Django and Flask, and I've also done some data analysis using pandas and numpy. I recently worked on a machine learning project where we implemented a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform. How do you handle error handling in Python? I usually use try-except blocks for error handling. I believe in catching specific exceptions rather than using bare except clauses. I also make sure to log errors properly and provide meaningful error messages. Sometimes I create custom exceptions for specific use cases in my applications. Can you explain your experience with database optimization? Yes, I've worked on optimizing database queries in PostgreSQL. I mainly focus on proper indexing, query optimization, and using appropriate JOIN operations. I've also implemented database caching using Redis to improve performance in high-traffic applications. are you intersted in working in language other than python. I am not personally interested b ut will do if i am assigned to it
